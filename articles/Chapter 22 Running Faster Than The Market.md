## **Running Faster Than the Market**

##### Retail's next competitive edge is not a feature. It is an operating tempo in the age of artificial intelligence.



> *“Well, in our country,” said Alice, still panting a little, “you’d generally get to somewhere else—if you run very fast for a long time, as we’ve been doing.”*
>
> *“A slow sort of country!” said the Queen. “Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!”*

*Lewis Carroll, Through the Looking-Glass*



On January 8, Salesforce reported that global online sales reached $1.29 trillion during the 2025 holiday season. Artificial intelligence influenced 20% of those sales, driving $262 billion in revenue through personalized recommendations and customer service.[1] Within Salesforce’s observed data, shoppers referred from AI platforms such as ChatGPT converted far more often than those from social media.[2] Salesforce reported that, within its observed data set, retailers using their own AI agents saw sales growth 59% higher than competitors who did not.[3]

A day earlier, IBM and the National Retail Federation published findings from a global survey of over 18,000 consumers. While 72% still shop in stores, 45% now use AI during their buying journeys, whether to research products, interpret reviews, or hunt for deals.[4] The paradox is uncomfortable for incumbents. Physical retail has not been abandoned. The decision-making that precedes a store visit is increasingly delegated to machines retailers do not control.

In January, Walmart and Google announced a partnership to integrate Walmart and Sam's Club products directly into Google's Gemini AI assistant. The collaboration relies on Google's Universal Commerce Protocol, an open standard designed to connect AI-driven discovery to checkout across multiple retailers.[5] Days later, Alibaba upgraded its Qwen AI app to include food ordering, travel booking, and payment execution inside a single conversational interface. Qwen reached 100 million monthly active users within two months of launch.[6]

The strategic question for chief executives is not whether AI can recommend a product. It is whether organizations can learn and adapt faster than competitors in a market where the interface between customers and commerce shifts weekly.

## Speed as strategy

Retail executives have long competed on scale, sourcing, and brand. The next 12 to 24 months will test a different capability: the organizational ability to turn data into decisions, decisions into execution, and execution into revised decisions at pace. This is less a technology question than a managerial one.

The vocabulary comes from evolutionary biology. Leigh Van Valen's Red Queen hypothesis describes systems that must keep adapting simply to maintain their relative position.[7] Organizational scholars applied the idea to markets, arguing that competition triggers internal learning and that learning intensifies competition.[8] Retail is entering this phase because AI compresses cycle time. It lowers the labor cost of experiments, reduces the time needed to analyze results, and accelerates rollouts. Those shifts do not create equilibrium. They raise the baseline rate of change.

This is where the familiar language of digital transformation looks dated. Transformation implies a program with a beginning and an end. Agentic commerce is better understood as a permanent condition in which decisions are continuously tested against an environment that changes at weekly cadence. McKinsey notes that transformation success rates hover around 30%, and fewer than one-third of companies achieve their planned impact from digital and AI initiatives.[9] The problem is not ambition. It is the capacity to convert ambition into operating change, repeatedly.

The implication is clear. A retailer's competitive position will increasingly reflect its learning rate.

## The power-law problem

Most retail technologies deliver incremental improvements. AI does not always behave that way. Early signals suggest adoption is widespread, but outcomes are uneven.

Nvidia reported in early 2025 that 89% of retailers were using or evaluating AI, and 97% planned to increase AI investment within a year.[10] Those are self-reported survey figures. They still tell a story: AI is now widely perceived as a source of operating improvement, not an experiment.

A second set of numbers is more sobering. McKinsey's "State of AI" survey found that almost nine-tenths of respondents were using generative AI in at least one business function. Only 7% said their organizations had fully scaled it, and more than 60% were still waiting to see a material effect on earnings before interest and taxes.[11]

That unevenness breaks the logic of many retail technology portfolios. It demands capital-allocation thinking: concentrate effort where the upside is high, and stop treating every use case as equally deserving of time and governance attention. BCG found that leading companies prioritize fewer AI use cases than peers, and those leaders anticipate materially higher returns.[12] The conclusion is not that a retailer should copy a benchmark count. It is that focus is rational when the constraint is operating capacity.

## Retail built for efficiency, not iteration

The hardest part of running faster than the market is that many retailers are structurally slow. The constraint is not a shortage of data. It is the cost of turning data into decisions that survive contact with stores, supply chains, and payments systems.

Retailers usually operate with systems built for different eras: point-of-sale platforms, e-commerce platforms, warehouse-management systems, marketing tools, loyalty engines, and product-information systems. Each has its own data model and commercial constraints. In many organizations, the only reliable integration point is a periodic report that arrives too late to be useful. That architecture can support scale. It struggles to support speed.

McKinsey described the consequence in a 2022 paper on retail's tech transformation. Digital leaders generated 3.3 times the total shareholder return of digital laggards between 2016 and 2020.[13] The point is not that software alone drives returns. It is that execution speed increasingly shows up in financial outcomes.

Agentic systems raise the bar again. A recommendation engine can tolerate stale data and partial coverage. An agent that completes transactions cannot. It needs accurate inventory, current pricing, and reliable fulfillment options. It needs permissions to act, auditable logs, and clear escalation paths. It needs to fail safely when the system is unsure.

This is why "add AI to the front end" strategies often disappoint. When the data foundations are weak, the agent becomes a source of error and operational noise. In retail, that noise shows up as substitution failures, customer-service calls, returns, fraud exposure, and store-level distrust of central systems.

## Agents move the control point

The visible shift in agentic commerce is interface design. The more consequential shift is where decisions are made and who benefits from them.

In the pre-agent world, retailers invested heavily in controlling entry points: search placement, apps, stores, and loyalty. In an agentic world, the entry point becomes a model that chooses among options based on a consumer's preferences, constraints, and history. IBM and NRF's findings point to this drift. Consumers may still buy in stores, but they are already using AI in shopping activity, which changes how options are filtered and ranked before purchase.[14] Salesforce's holiday report adds a more direct signal: third-party AI search referrals are growing, and those users convert at far higher rates than social referrals.[15] One plausible interpretation is that when a model sends a shopper to a retailer, much of the sorting has already happened upstream.

Platforms are building to capture that value. Google's Universal Commerce Protocol is positioned as a standard to connect AI-assisted discovery to checkout across merchants, with major retailers cited as collaborators.[16] Walmart's partnership with Google aims to make its catalog and checkout available through conversational experiences, which reduces friction for consumers and also shifts discovery away from Walmart-controlled surfaces.[17]

China's trajectory points to a second model: the agent as a super-interface embedded in a payments and services ecosystem. Alibaba's Qwen upgrade integrates commerce and payments services into a single AI interface that can complete transactions.[18] In such systems, the strategic issue for a retailer is not only search placement. It is whether the retailer's products, terms, and customer-service rules are interpretable and preferred by the agent.

The bargaining power implications are predictable. If AI interfaces become a dominant discovery and transaction layer, operators of those interfaces gain influence over merchandising, visibility, and access to customer data.

## Why retailers feel stuck

Most large retailers understand the direction of travel. Many are struggling to translate that understanding into operating change. The reason is not a lack of pilots. It is the lack of a repeatable path from pilots to scaled workflow change.

The gap between adoption and scaling is the first clue. Nvidia's survey suggests broad usage and positive sentiment among retailers.[19] McKinsey's work shows that only a small share have fully scaled generative AI and that most are still waiting for earnings impact.[20] Both can be true at once. Many teams can use AI tools locally, and few firms can change enterprise operations.

Retail's operating model amplifies the difficulty. Supply chains are tightly coupled. Pricing and promotions ripple across channels. Stores and e-commerce often share inventory but not decision rights. A change that improves conversion online can create store-level shortages. A change that reduces labor hours can damage service. It is hard to run fast when every change carries a cross-channel risk profile.

IBM's retail research hints at the organizational friction. It found that 54% of retail executives cited persistent challenges in delivering a consistent shopping experience across channels, and that the same share struggled to use customer data effectively across channels.[21] Agentic commerce raises those stakes because inconsistency becomes a direct source of model error and customer distrust.

A second obstacle is ownership. Many retailers still treat AI as a technology project owned by the CIO or a digital team. That framing creates a bottleneck. When every use case requires central approval, iteration slows. When AI is owned by a central group without authority over merchandising, pricing, and operations, scaling stalls.

Some companies have started to make the selection pressure explicit. In a widely reported 2025 memo, Shopify's chief executive, Tobi Lütke, said reflexive AI usage would be a baseline expectation and that teams should demonstrate why AI cannot do a task before requesting additional headcount.[22] That approach carries cultural and reputational risks. It also captures a truth many executives avoid stating: the organization's ability to learn AI workflows has become part of competitive capacity.

Retailers that do not make expectations explicit tend to get the same outcome: pockets of experimentation, a few successful tools, and limited operating change.

## The emerging operating model

Retail leaders often describe AI as something to roll out across the enterprise. A more useful framing is to treat AI as a portfolio of multipliers. A multiplier is an intervention that does more than add productivity in one task. It increases the speed and quality of decisions across a workflow.

In retail, the multipliers tend to share three features: they occur frequently, they involve many variables, and they have measurable outcomes. Demand forecasting and replenishment fit. Customer service fits. Fraud detection fits. Personalization fits. Vendor negotiations often do not, at least not in the near term.

The portfolio logic matters because agentic systems require more than software. They require redesigned decision rights, tighter data discipline, and governance that can withstand mistakes. Those investments do not spread cleanly across dozens of initiatives.

The JD Sports announcement in January is a crisp example of the new requirement. JD said it would enable customers in the United States to search and buy products directly through AI platforms including Microsoft Copilot, Google's Gemini, and OpenAI's ChatGPT. It described a partnership with commercetools and Stripe intended to connect AI-driven search to secure checkout and payments.[23] Behind the announcement sits a clear operational requirement: product information, pricing, and inventory must be structured and current enough for external agents to transact against them.

Customer service is facing the same shift. Salesforce reports that retailers using their own agents saw higher growth during the holiday season, and that shoppers used retailer-provided AI for customer service 126% more during the holiday rush than in the prior two months.[24] The exact multipliers will vary by retailer and by data set. The operational reality does not: agents are being asked to do work, not discuss work.

This is where many companies will stumble. A conversational assistant can bluff without immediate cost. A service agent that initiates returns must be correct. A purchase agent must handle authentication, fraud checks, tax, and address validation. A replenishment agent must not empty a shelf because a model misread a promotion.

The portfolio approach is a way to manage those risks. It concentrates investment where payoffs and learning are highest, while limiting the scope of errors when agents fail.

## Strategic implications

Agentic commerce is often framed as a channel story. Chief executives should treat it as an operating-model story with channel consequences. Five implications deserve attention.

First, speed becomes a board-level operating metric. Sales growth and margin still matter. CEOs should also ask a more revealing question: how quickly can the organization test a change, measure it, and roll it out across channels. In agentic commerce, that cadence determines whether a retailer can respond to shifts in consumer interfaces controlled by platforms.

Second, the critical asset is not a model. It is the system of record around decisions. Agents can be purchased. Decision logs cannot. When an agent makes a pricing recommendation, it needs data lineage, an explanation of the recommendation, and controls for exceptions. The EU's AI Act, now in a phased implementation period, is already pushing toward governance and transparency expectations. Prohibited AI practices and AI literacy obligations applied from February 2, 2025, and obligations for general-purpose AI models applied from August 2, 2025.[25]

Third, identity and payments move from background infrastructure to strategic constraint. Agentic commerce fails without trusted authentication and secure payment delegation. Standards are evolving. The FIDO Alliance is pushing passkeys, which replace passwords with cryptographic credentials designed to reduce phishing risk.[26] EMVCo's tokenization standards allow payment credentials to be replaced with tokens, reducing exposure of underlying account numbers.[27] In Europe, PSD2 and associated strong customer authentication rules have already forced merchants to treat authentication design as part of conversion economics.[28] Retailers cannot set these rules unilaterally, but they can choose architectures and partners that make compliance and customer trust manageable.

Fourth, platform dependency becomes an explicit strategic choice. Google's Universal Commerce Protocol is presented as an open standard with participation from large retailers and platforms.[29] If it succeeds, integration costs may fall. The corollary is that whoever controls the dominant conversational entry point gains influence over discovery and transaction economics. China's ecosystem model may move faster because payments, commerce, and delivery can be integrated into one interface, as Alibaba's Qwen upgrade illustrates.[30]

Fifth, the workforce debate shifts from job counts to decision quality. Some firms are treating AI proficiency as a baseline expectation, as Shopify did.[31] That approach will spread beyond technology companies because it is a direct response to competitive pace. The risk is that mandates become symbolic and breed resentment. The opportunity is that retailers can raise their learning rate by making AI training, workflow redesign, and experimentation part of management's formal responsibilities.

These implications play out differently by retail format. In big-box and grocery, the highest near-term upside sits in replenishment, substitutions, customer service, and personalized offers. Frequency and operational complexity create many surfaces for small improvements. The near-term risk is that agentic shopping increases "good enough" behavior, pushing shoppers toward assisted replenishment and away from browsing. Retailers with strong private-label economics should pay attention to how agents rank and substitute products.

In marketplaces, agentic commerce intensifies the fight over discovery. If external AI interfaces become a major traffic source, marketplaces will have to decide whether to integrate, resist, or build their own agents. Their advantage is breadth of assortment and rich behavioral data. Their vulnerability is that their own sellers can be recommended elsewhere.

In direct-to-consumer brands, agents threaten the economics of paid acquisition. If a model can recommend a product without a search ad, brand strength and structured product information rise in value. The more practical investment may be better product data and better post-purchase service, because those influence the signals agents use when deciding what to recommend and where to send a shopper.

In luxury, the risk is not only disintermediation. It is loss of control over narrative and clienteling. IBM-NRF's study includes a comment from LVMH's chief omnichannel officer that AI can contribute to product discovery but cannot replace human connection.[32] Luxury depends on scarcity, service, and trust. Agents that treat luxury as commodity recommendation can create reputational risk. The category is likely to adopt agentic systems first in internal operations, such as demand planning and fraud prevention, and later in customer-facing guidance with strict control.

The fragility of the legacy department-store model offers a caution. In January, Reuters reported that Saks Global filed for bankruptcy in New York and planned to emerge later in 2026, months after completing its acquisition of Neiman Marcus.[33] The financing mechanics matter less here than the strategic reminder the episode offers: when retail models fall out of step with consumer behavior and platform shifts, financial stress tends to follow.

## Signals to watch

The next two years will be noisy. CEOs should watch for signals that indicate whether agentic commerce is becoming a dominant behavior or a niche feature.

Agent-referred traffic becomes a primary source of high-intent visits, as third-party AI referrals grow as a share of sessions and conversion. Standards and protocols move from announcement to integration, particularly those that connect AI discovery to checkout. Retailers' own agents shift from customer-service containment to transaction completion, including returns, exchanges, and order changes at scale. Authentication and payment delegation become routine, reducing friction in agent-initiated purchases without increasing fraud loss. Regulatory compliance work becomes part of day-to-day operating cadence, especially for retailers operating across Europe and Asia.

A stall would show up in different places: persistent errors in agent outputs, high-profile fraud incidents tied to agent-initiated transactions, rising platform tolls for commerce participation, or regulator-led restrictions that change how consumer-facing agents can operate.

## What this does not claim

Agentic commerce is an unstable term. It is also an invitation to hype. Some boundaries help.

This argument does not assume AI agents will replace stores. IBM's study suggests consumers still prefer stores for purchases, even as they use AI for shopping activity.[34] The likely near-term outcome is that stores remain central while decision-making before the store visit becomes more automated.

This argument does not assume retailers will lose customer relationships entirely. It suggests the interface through which customers make decisions will increasingly be mediated by systems retailers do not control. That shifts power without eliminating room for differentiation.

This argument does not assume every retailer should build a foundation model. Most should not. The competitive question is whether the retailer can incorporate AI into workflows in a way that improves decision speed without degrading governance and trust.

Finally, this argument does not assume regulation will freeze progress. It assumes governance expectations will rise at the same time consumer-facing agents proliferate. China's Interim Measures for the Management of Generative AI Services took effect in August 2023.[35] China's Personal Information Protection Law sets constraints on personal-data processing and, in some cases, cross-border transfers.[36] Europe's AI Act timeline is already in motion.[37] The regimes differ, but they share a direction: more accountability, more documentation, less tolerance for opaque automation.

The United States is likely to move more through enforcement and voluntary frameworks than through a single omnibus AI law. NIST's AI Risk Management Framework is one example of how governance language is being standardized even without uniform federal regulation.[38]

## The bottom line

The case for running faster than the market is not that every retailer needs an agent. It is that advantage increasingly accrues to organizations that can change quickly, safely, and repeatedly.

The next 12 to 24 months will be shaped by three overlapping developments. Consumer interfaces will keep shifting toward conversational and agent-driven experiences, pulled by platforms and reinforced by measurable behavior. Commerce infrastructure will begin to standardize for those interfaces. Protocols that connect AI discovery to checkout, and retailer initiatives that enable purchases inside AI platforms, will move from pilots into production integration. Governance and trust expectations will rise at the same time. The EU AI Act milestones are landing, China's AI and privacy regimes are established, and risk frameworks are becoming more formal. The margin for error will shrink in markets where regulators, consumers, and the press are ready to punish misuse.

Speed is no longer a byproduct of efficiency. It is a design choice. Retailers that treat agentic commerce as an external trend will experience it as a loss of control. Retailers that treat it as pressure to rebuild decision systems will still face platform power and regulatory constraints, but they will have a better chance of keeping up.

In a market where the interface can change overnight, the slowest thing in the room is often the organization.
