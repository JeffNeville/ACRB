**The Tipping Point**

**Four forces are accelerating the rise of agentic commerce**

Artificial intelligence agents are evolving from passive recommendation engines into active purchasing entities capable of researching products, negotiating prices and completing transactions without human oversight. This transformation represents more than an upgrade to customer service chatbots. Retailers must now prepare for a world where their most valuable customers may be machines equipped with spending budgets, style preferences and algorithmic precision.

This shift from theoretical possibility to commercial reality is being driven by four converging forces. Together, they are fundamentally rewiring customer relationships and creating an entirely new category of buyer with distinct behavioral patterns.

**The infrastructure is ready**

The retail industry's digital backbone has evolved to support autonomous AI shopping agents. Cloud platforms, open APIs and software-as-a-service tools have become standard across the sector, creating environments where AI-driven agents can integrate and transact seamlessly.

Some 67% of retailers now use cloud-based point-of-sale software², reflecting a broader transformation that is driving the global retail cloud market from $28.3 billion in 2024 to a projected $81.3 billion by 2030³, representing annual growth of 19.2%. America alone accounted for $7.7 billion in 2024\.

The migration extends beyond moving technology stacks to the cloud. Modern commerce systems increasingly rely on open APIs, which Gartner considers essential for "interoperability with customer data, product content, and order functionality."¹ By 2025, 96% of companies will use public cloud services¹², creating standardized environments that AI agents can navigate with ease. The result is an interconnected ecosystem where data flows through common technological languages.

Payment infrastructure is adapting to accommodate autonomous transactions. Visa's new "Intelligent Commerce" APIs⁴ enable AI agents to conduct payments at 150 million merchants worldwide using tokenized credentials. According to the company's product chief, "soon people will have AI agents browse, select, purchase and manage on their behalf." Mastercard's forthcoming Agent Pay system⁴, developed with Microsoft and IBM, is designed to treat algorithms as card-holding shoppers.

Retail specific software applications are demonstrating the viability of autonomous commerce. In 2025, Kibo introduced an autonomous commerce suite that integrates with retailers' order-management APIs. Initial clients reported 40% reductions in manual merchandising work and nine-percentage-point improvements in conversion rates. Shopify's latest AI assistant, Magic, can autonomously draft marketing copy, update inventory and adjust pricing with minimal human oversight.

**The economics are compelling**

The promise of artificial intelligence is finally delivering measurable returns in retail, spurring a wave of investment as executives seek concrete value rather than mere technological novelty. Intelligent systems now automate mundane tasks, enhance decision-making through data analysis, and provide round-the-clock operational support. The result is a compelling business case that has convinced supply-chain leaders to open their wallets: 62% report that AI agents embedded in their workflows have accelerated organizational decision-making⁷. These systems can monitor inventory levels and automatically trigger restocking orders or reroute shipments with a speed that human workers cannot match.

The benefits extend beyond mere cost reduction. A survey by NVIDIA of retail and consumer-packaged-goods executives found that 69% of AI adopters saw increased revenue, while 72% reduced operating expenses⁶. Companies that invested heavily in AI-powered supply-chain solutions achieved revenue growth 61% higher than their more cautious competitors, according to analysis of industry leaders⁷.

Corporate spending patterns reflect this newfound confidence. More than 60% of retail executives plan to increase their AI infrastructure investments over the next 18 months⁶. An IBM study of global chief executives found that 85% expect significant returns from large-scale AI investments by 2027, anticipating average returns of 14% on their AI spending⁸. This optimism has transformed AI from an experimental curiosity into a strategic necessity. Executives now view the risk of forgoing AI investment as greater than the risk of embracing it, given the competitive advantages at stake.

**Consumers are ready**

Shoppers are increasingly comfortable delegating purchasing decisions to AI, creating demand-side momentum for autonomous commerce. American consumers are experimenting with generative AI tools for product advice, and many express willingness to hand routine shopping tasks to AI personal assistants.

Accenture's 2025 global consumer survey⁹ found that nearly one in ten consumers (9%) now rank generative AI as their most trusted source for purchase advice, surpassing social media or brand communications. Over one-third of active generative AI users describe the technology as feeling like "a good friend." This trust translates into action: half of generative AI users have made purchases based on AI recommendations.

Consumer openness to AI assistance spans the entire shopping journey. In Accenture's study, 75% of consumers expressed willingness⁹ to use a "trusted AI-powered personal shopper" to handle tasks such as searching for and purchasing products. American-focused research confirms this readiness. In one survey, nearly 60% of consumers reported using AI to assist with shopping¹⁰ for tasks such as generating product ideas or finding deals. Almost half (46%) of consumers¹⁰, especially Generation Z and millennials, trust AI advice on clothing choices more than a friend's opinion.

Early adopters are finding value in these tools. Adobe's 2025 study of 5,000 American consumers revealed that 92%¹¹ of shoppers who used an AI chat assistant felt it enhanced their online shopping experience. These AI-assisted shoppers browsed more pages and had a 23% lower bounce rate on retail sites, indicating deeper engagement. Importantly, 87% of consumers who have used AI for shopping said they are more likely to use it for larger or more complex purchases.

The rise of generative AI is reshaping product discovery. Instead of browsing dozens of websites or reviews, many consumers turn to conversational AI queries. By early 2025, 39% of American consumers had used generative AI tools¹¹ such as ChatGPT for online shopping research, and 53% planned to do so within the next year. Among active generative AI users, these tools are now the second-most-preferred source of product recommendations (18% preference), trailing only in-store browsing.

**Executives are racing ahead**

Senior retail and brand executives are treating autonomous commerce as an urgent strategic priority rather than a distant experiment. Fear of falling behind competitors in AI capability is driving chief executives to invest aggressively. Several studies of corporate leadership show that many have concluded that waiting for proven returns or adopting a "fast follower" strategy could prove costly.

A majority of CEOs acknowledge funding AI initiatives before business value is fully proven, driven by competitive anxiety. In IBM's 2025 global CEO study, 64% of chief executives⁸ said the risk of falling behind competitively drives them to invest in technologies early, even without complete understanding of the value those technologies will deliver. Two-thirds feel they cannot afford to wait for perfect information, preferring to place strategic bets on AI now rather than risk playing catch-up later.

Executive urgency is evident in deployment timelines. According to the IBM survey, 61% of CEOs⁸ report their organizations are actively adopting AI agents and preparing to implement them at scale. Many corporate leaders have created dedicated AI task forces, appointed Chief AI Officers or approved pilot programs for autonomous customer service representatives and procurement systems.

The competitive window to leverage AI for advantage is perceived as narrow. Nearly two in three CEOs (64%)⁸ told IBM researchers that they are betting on certain technologies without full return clarity because they refuse to be left behind. This urgency is reflected in how CEOs frame their strategies, setting ambitious AI adoption targets and viewing AI as a long-term growth driver rather than merely a cost-reduction tool.

Notably, 85% of CEOs⁸ expect investments in AI for efficiency and cost optimization to yield positive returns by 2027, and 77% expect AI-driven revenue-growth initiatives to pay off in that timeframe. This optimism, coupled with competitive anxiety, means chief executives are racing to integrate autonomous AI into core business processes.

**What lies ahead**

The convergence of these four forces suggests that autonomous commerce is transitioning from experimental technology to commercial reality. Technical infrastructure appears ready, cost and revenue benefits are demonstrable, consumers show receptivity and executives express both commitment and urgency. The question is not whether AI agents will influence retail, but rather the pace and extent of their adoption.

Yet theory must yield to practice. While the foundations for autonomous commerce are solidifying, the true test lies in execution. How are forward-thinking companies actually deploying autonomous AI in their operations? What challenges emerge when algorithms begin making purchasing decisions at scale? Which early implementations offer the clearest roadmap for others to follow?

The answers to these questions will determine whether the retail revolution arrives as a gradual evolution or a sudden disruption. Either way, the algorithm is already browsing the aisles.
