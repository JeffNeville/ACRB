**If AI Can’t Read Your Products, You Don’t Exist**

*How retailers lose visibility and sales when their product data isn’t built for AI-driven consumers and agents.*

A long-envisioned transaction occurred recently when a user asked ChatGPT to buy running shoes. Within seconds, the AI searched inventories, compared prices, evaluated reviews, and completed a purchase across multiple retailers. The consumer never visited a website or touched a shopping cart. The entire experience happened inside a conversation. In September 2025, OpenAI made this mainstream with Instant Checkout, an in‑chat cart with credit‑card payments powered by Stripe and the co‑developed Agentic Commerce Protocol. U.S. users can now complete purchases from Etsy sellers in ChatGPT, with support for Shopify merchants coming soon, without leaving the conversation.

This is agentic commerce, and it represents a fundamental reconfiguration of retail economics. AI agents now execute shopping tasks autonomously, negotiating and transacting on behalf of humans. The implications are stark. Retailers who cannot feed clean, structured, real-time data to these algorithms risk becoming invisible. Product information, long relegated to back-office operations, has become a profit center.

**Machines as customers**

Traditional e-commerce serves human browsers. Agentic commerce, or A-commerce, inverts that model. AI buyer agents anticipate needs, search inventories, evaluate options, and complete transactions, often without direct human involvement. Amazon's "Buy for Me" assistant and ChatGPT's "Instant Checkout" already demonstrate this shift. Amazon's AI completes purchases from third-party sites within its app, while ChatGPT allows mid-conversation buying through the Agentic Commerce Protocol, a framework developed with Stripe.

The mechanics matter. A buyer's agent queries multiple retailer systems simultaneously, demanding structured responses: price, stock status, shipping windows, product attributes. Retailers whose systems cannot answer instantly lose the sale. This creates two types of interaction. Consumer-to-merchant exchanges see buyer agents interrogating retailer APIs in parallel. Merchant-to-merchant collaboration involves retailer systems coordinating to source, fulfill, or substitute items in real time.

Success in this environment depends on fluency. Can your systems participate in algorithmic negotiations at machine speed? The answer hinges on data architecture.

**The quality gap**

Most retailers collect vast amounts of product information. IBM research shows that less than a quarter of it can be consumed by AI systems. The remainder sits fragmented across ERP platforms, product information management systems, and spreadsheets, inconsistent and inaccessible.

AI agents demand precision. They must parse catalogs instantly, evaluate availability, calculate delivery times, compare sustainability metrics. Incomplete or inaccessible data triggers a simple response: the agent moves on. The sale goes to a competitor whose information is clean, structured, and current.

This transforms product data from support function to revenue driver. McKinsey and BCG warn that retailers risk invisibility in AI-mediated marketplaces if their data cannot be compared and trusted by autonomous systems. Data readiness now directly influences top-line growth.

**Building machine-readable infrastructure**

Competing in agentic commerce requires modernizing two core systems: Product Information Management and Master Data Management. The objective is data performance, ensuring every attribute, image, and price point is prepared for machine consumption.

First, centralization. Establish a single authoritative record for every SKU. Product dimensions, composition, regulatory data, and ratings must align across all channels. Modern PIM systems reconcile discrepancies automatically and enforce service-level agreements on data freshness.

Second, expand taxonomies. AI systems require specificity. Farfetch's catalog of 3,400 brands uses a fashion knowledge graph standardizing thousands of descriptors, allowing AI models to recognize that "puffer coat" and "down jacket" refer to equivalent items. Retailers should conduct attribute gap analyses for major categories, identifying missing fields such as fit data, sustainability scores, or resale value, then expanding schemas accordingly.

Third, adopt interoperability standards. Industry identifiers like GS1 UPCs and UNSPSC classifications help agents match identical products across sites. Mapping internal schemas to external standards ensures compatibility with Google, Amazon, and emerging agent-to-agent protocols including Google's A2A, Anthropic's Model Context Protocol, and ACP.

Fourth, expose data through APIs. Retailers must treat these interfaces as storefronts for machines. A buyer agent querying "black running shoes, size 9, available in two days" expects a fast, reliable answer. APIs delivering product, inventory, and price data with low latency determine whether the sale completes. Leading retailers implement tiered access, offering richer datasets to trusted partners or charging for premium feeds.

The outcome is digital architecture that communicates fluently with other machines. Clean, connected, and accessible data determines whether an AI agent recommends your product or ignores it.

**Generative AI as co-pilot**

Generative AI is transforming how retailers manage product information. Instead of relying on teams to write copy and tag images, AI extracts, generates, and validates content at scale.

Tools like Anglera and companies like The Yes and True Fit use computer vision and natural language processing to assign hundreds of attributes per garment automatically. Retailers deploy GenAI to draft standardized product descriptions, translate them, and create feature lists in consistent tone. eBay's listing AI produces full product copy from minimal input.

Visual creation follows similar patterns. AI generates lifestyle imagery, adjusts backgrounds, or creates size variants without additional photo shoots. Some brands produce virtual try-ons using GenAI models tailored to customer body data.

Governance remains essential. Human validation loops prevent factual errors or off-brand tone. The most effective retailers use AI as a co-pilot, accelerating data creation while maintaining editorial control. Deloitte Digital estimates that by 2025, most product content will be AI-generated, freeing marketing teams to focus on strategy rather than manual production.

**The speed imperative**

In agentic commerce, data timeliness determines competitiveness. If a buyer agent cannot confirm stock or delivery instantly, it selects another retailer. Synchronizing inventory, pricing, and fulfillment data across every channel in near real time becomes mandatory.

Adidas, Levi's, and Burberry integrate AI into logistics, using predictive models to manage overstock and reroute slow-moving items, improving sell-through and reliability. These capabilities now underpin trust in AI-mediated transactions.

Retailers should target live inventory updates from order management, warehouse, and point-of-sale systems; dynamic pricing feeds reflecting promotions and local conditions; and fulfillment status APIs confirming delivery windows within seconds.

Accuracy matters for customer satisfaction and algorithmic preference. Agents prioritize retailers whose data is fast, consistent, and verified.

**Generative engine optimization**

Search engine optimization once determined Google rankings. In the age of generative search, visibility depends on how well data feeds answer engines like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Perplexity.

Generative Engine Optimization represents the new discipline. To ensure AI agents recommend their products, retailers must provide machine-readable data with structured markup, updated feeds, and comprehensive content. The priority is representation, not ranking. Each AI platform surfaces only a few product suggestions. To capture that space, retailers must ensure comprehensive product attributes, up-to-date price and delivery data, and reliable customer ratings.

Retailers should monitor where products appear in generative engines and why. Fleet Feet won AI placement for certain running shoes because its feed provided correct local pricing and currency data, details competing retailers missed. In GEO, every attribute is a ranking factor. Each missing field represents lost revenue.

**Measuring data as an asset**

Shifting from maintenance to monetization requires tracking the financial impact of data quality. Several metrics define performance in the agentic era.

Attribute completeness and accuracy measure the share of SKUs with all required fields populated. Time to publish tracks average lag between product creation and full syndication across systems. API uptime and latency gauge the speed and reliability of machine-to-machine interactions. Conversion uplift quantifies revenue improvement correlated with better product data. Return-rate reduction captures fewer mismatches between expectation and reality due to richer content.

Retailers who measure these see tangible gains. One European apparel brand reduced returns by 14% after improving product copy accuracy and imagery consistency. Another saw online conversion rise 9% after closing attribute gaps in its footwear catalog.

Treating product data as an asset means assigning ownership, budgets, and accountability, just as with any revenue-generating function.

**Organizational transformation**

Technology alone cannot make data profitable. The organizational model must evolve.

Clear ownership is foundational. Establish a responsibility framework across merchandising, digital, and data teams. Merchants own attribute accuracy, digital teams manage content and imagery, IT oversees integration and APIs. A data council or product data office should govern standards and quality thresholds.

New roles emerge. The data product manager oversees API performance and adoption. The knowledge engineer manages taxonomy and ontology for AI agents. The AI content editor ensures GenAI outputs remain accurate and on-brand.

AI integration alters workflows. Merchandisers and copywriters shift from creating to supervising content. Category managers rely on AI analytics instead of intuition. Success requires training, transparency, and leadership support. This is the hybrid workforce, humans and machines collaborating in real time.

Security and compliance grow more critical as systems share data externally. Strong authentication, encryption, and consent management are essential. Retailers should mirror the Agentic Commerce Protocol's model: minimal data sharing, explicit user consent, and secure payment tokens.

**Monetization models**

Once data pipelines and governance mature, retailers can monetize information directly. Several models are emerging.

Premium API access offers real-time product, inventory, or pricing data to partners or marketplaces for a fee. Retail media integration uses product data to power sponsored placements within generative engines. Insight exchange sells anonymized demand or trend data to suppliers. Dynamic affiliate models enable external agents to earn commissions for driving verified AI-mediated sales.

The common denominator is high-quality, trustworthy data. The more reliable your feeds, the more valuable they become to others in the ecosystem.

**The early movers**

Several companies illustrate what data readiness looks like in practice.

Amazon treats product data as infrastructure. Its APIs and taxonomy have set industry standards. With "Buy for Me," it now extends control beyond its marketplace. Walmart partnered with OpenAI to let users purchase products directly within ChatGPT, signaling readiness for agentic transactions at global scale. Shopify integrated the Agentic Commerce Protocol across its merchant base, enabling small brands to participate in AI shopping ecosystems.

Farfetch built a taxonomy and knowledge graph allowing precise, automated styling recommendations, a blueprint for fashion retail. Nike and Inditex use AI to personalize fit, manage inventory, and dynamically price products, providing the real-time feedback loops required for agentic commerce.

These companies treat product information as a living asset, continuously maintained and monetized.

**The executive agenda**

Agentic commerce is unfolding now, not in some distant future. Retailers who invest early in data readiness will capture disproportionate value as AI-mediated purchasing becomes mainstream.

The CEO's task is elevating data from technical concern to strategic priority. That means funding modern PIM and MDM systems, setting measurable quality KPIs, and integrating product data into growth plans. It also means reframing teams around a new reality: in agentic commerce, data is the brand experience.

The retail industry faces a stark choice. Companies that treat data with the same care they devote to stores or merchandise will thrive in the agent era. Those who ignore it will find their products invisible to the algorithms that now decide what gets bought. The storefront has moved from the street to the server, from the screen to the API. Retailers must follow.
