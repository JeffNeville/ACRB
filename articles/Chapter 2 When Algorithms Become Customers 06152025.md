# **When Algorithms Become Customers: How Agentic AI is Transforming Retail**

*A chief executive who once marveled at chatbots that recommend shoes must now contemplate something stranger: software that buys the shoes.*

*Agentic AI refers to autonomous software that can perceive, decide and act toward set goals. ¹*

In our previous analysis, we proposed that agentic AI is poised to transform commerce with autonomous agents set to become the most valuable customer segment by 2030\. We introduced how these digital intermediaries will fundamentally reshape customer-brand relationships, prioritizing transactional efficiency over emotional loyalty. The implications extend far beyond customer service chatbots; we are witnessing the emergence of autonomous commerce entities that can research, negotiate and purchase without human intervention.  
The newest wave of artificial intelligence, agentic AI, grants algorithms with autonomy. These agents can browse, decide, negotiate and execute transactions within parameters set by flesh-and-blood owners. Retailers, already challenged by omnichannel commerce, now face a more radical shift: their most valuable customers may soon be machines.  
This transformation represents a competitive necessity, not merely an opportunity. Early adopters will establish and build a lead, while laggards will decelerate and risk obsolescence in an algorithmic marketplace.

## **From words to actions**

Generative models produce content on demand but they remain passive until prompted. Agentic AI goes further. Gartner defines an AI agent as "goal-driven software that perceives, decides and acts" without continuous human prompting.¹ Think of each agent as a three-part organism: a language-model *brain* that plots sub-goals, specialized *hands* that execute them, and digital *eyes* that monitor progress.

That small step from passivity to purpose turns a language model into a colleague. Give it spending limits and style preferences and it will scour catalogues, place orders, track parcels and file returns, disturbing its human only when exceptions arise.

Where generative AI complements human buyers, agentic AI *is* the buyer, ready to be trusted (or blamed) for outcomes. Merchants that once courted fickle emotions must now impress systems obsessed with price, speed and pristine data. Storytelling still matters, but chiefly because it influences the settings shoppers assign their digital delegates. 

## **Evidence of agency**

The transformation is no longer theoretical. Across retail, the infrastructure of autonomous commerce is taking shape.

**Payments lead the charge.** Visa's new Intelligent Commerce APIs let developers embed tokenized credentials so AI shoppers can pay across 150m merchants without exposing card numbers.² "Soon people will have AI agents browse, select, purchase and manage on their behalf," says Jack Forestell, Visa's product chief.³ Mastercard's response, Agent Pay, offers similar rails and is being built with Microsoft and IBM as launch partners.⁴ Together the networks are drafting identity and risk models that treat an algorithm as a cardholder.

**Marketplaces move swiftly.** Amazon's pilot feature, Buy for Me, lets an agent call on third-party sites, check out and monitor delivery without shoppers leaving Amazon's app.⁵ Sensitive data stay encrypted; Amazon keeps the relationship while rivals fulfil the order.

**Commerce platforms jump in.** In March Kibo unveiled Agentic Commerce, a pre-trained multi-agent suite that plugs into order-management APIs; early clients report a 40% cut in manual merchandising and a nine-point lift in conversion.⁶ Shopify is taking a similar tack. Shopify Magic and its Sidekick assistant now analyze store data, draft marketing campaigns and trigger inventory tasks entering orders or discounting slow movers without human clicks.⁷ For thousands of small merchants, that amounts to a round-the-clock operations chief.

**Operations follow suit.** An IBM Institute for Business Value survey finds 62% of supply-chain leaders embedding AI agents; firms investing heavily report revenue growth 61% higher than peers.⁸ In trials, a retailer that exposed real-time stock and delivery APIs saw its conversion rate with AI shoppers jump 11%.⁸ Salesforce's Agentforce pushes the same logic into customer service and B2B sales, fielding autonomous reps that pursue leads round the clock. Meanwhile, two-thirds of shoppers told a recent Salesforce poll they would let an AI agent hunt bargains or secure scarce goods on their behalf.⁹

## **Why now?**

Three forces converge to make this the moment for autonomous commerce:

**Infrastructure has matured.** Cloud providers, payment networks and integrators now speak a common, API-driven tongue. An agent can compare 50 suppliers before a human finishes their morning coffee.

**Algorithms have grown bolder.** Large language models can parse contracts, compose emails and call APIs, skills essential for multi-step commerce.

**Pressure is rising.** A recent IBM study found that many CEOs are investing in emerging technologies ahead of proven ROI, driven by a fear of being left behind.¹⁰ In their view, fast following no longer offers a competitive edge in a market defined by acceleration.

## **Courting algorithmic customers**

Winning an algorithm's business requires different strategies. Price still counts, but so do machine-readable trust signals: speed, real-time inventory, transparent delivery promises and a spotless fraud record. An inaccurate stock feed may merely annoy a human; an agent may blacklist the retailer altogether.

Loyalty, too, bifurcates. Humans can be wooed with stories and experiences. Their agents respond to quantifiable incentives: dynamic discounts, API-exposed perks or guaranteed service-level agreements. Expect dual-layer schemes: emotion for the person, math for the bot. 

## **Perils and pitfalls**

With autonomy comes peril. Governance is foremost: who pays when an agent breaches sanctions or double-orders stock? Regulators have yet to decide. Security matters as well. An autonomous buyer armed with corporate credit could be a hacker's dream target unless tokenization and behavioral checks keep pace. Expect standards-setting bodies to codify agent identity, consent and liability within two years; executives should press industry groups early rather than await edicts from Brussels or Washington.

There is also the danger of a race to the bottom. Agents optimize ruthlessly for measurable variables. If brands compete only on price and speed, margins may collapse. Savvy retailers will feed richer signals: carbon footprints, provenance data, hassle-free returns, nudging algorithms (and their owners) to value more than promotions.

Jobs will change, too. Agents handle drudgery; humans move upstream, designing prompts, curating data and arbitrating edge cases. Early adopters already speak of redeploying staff from transaction processing to experience design. 

## **A quiet revolution**

By 2030 your most profitable customer may be an algorithm: impatient, data-hungry and utterly indifferent to brand lore. Court it with facts, speed and reliable APIs, or risk becoming invisible in its blink-of-an-eye search.

Yet this transformation signals more than mere efficiency gains. Agentic AI represents a fundamental shift in how enterprises compete, operate and deliver value. The winners will be those who architect themselves into what Forrester Research calls "autonomous enterprises": firms that redesign their business models to harness agentic intelligence as a strategic differentiator rather than merely a cost-cutting tool, enabling new revenue streams, reshaped industries, and exponential scale.

Merchants who adapt earliest will trade with both species: humans on emotion, bots on efficiency. Those who hesitate may find that, in the silent negotiations of software, nobody remembers to call on them at all.   
*The transformation is underway. The question is no longer whether your customers will be machines, but whether you'll be ready when they arrive.*   
*Next week, I'll examine the market forces and compelling data behind this transformation—including the explosive growth projections that have investors and executives taking notice, the changing consumer behaviors that are creating demand, and why the convergence of technology maturity and competitive pressure is creating a "perfect storm" moment for agentic commerce.*
