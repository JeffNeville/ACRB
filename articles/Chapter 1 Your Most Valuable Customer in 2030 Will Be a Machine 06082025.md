**Your Most Valuable Customer in 2030 Will Be a Machine**

By 2030, your most loyal and most profitable customer might not be a human. It might be a machine.

This might sound like science fiction, but it's actually the logical outcome of today's rapid digital transformation, the rise of large language models, and the evolution of Agentic AI, autonomous agents that can search, negotiate, and buy on behalf of humans, faster and more efficiently than any human could.

Agentic AI is evolving beyond generative AI's content creation, focusing instead on decision-making and complex action execution. These autonomous systems, with limited supervision, are becoming integral to business operations. They're not just helpers, they're buyers, and soon they'll be the biggest segment of your customer base.

We're already seeing this future unfold. Mastercard, Visa, and PayPal have launched agent-driven payment initiatives using tokenization, enabling AI agents to complete purchases autonomously¹. Amazon's "Buy for Me" feature lets users purchase items via the Amazon app, even from third-party websites² and Walmart and Carrefour are testing smart carts that dynamically price items in real time, catering to algorithmic buyers³. IBM's research shows that 75% of executives expect AI agents to execute transactional processes autonomously within the next two years, operating 24/7 without breaks⁴.

And the market is enormous. The total addressable market for agentic commerce is projected to reach approximately $136 billion by 2025, with an expected growth to $1.7 trillion by 2030, a staggering compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 67%⁵. Brands that fail to evolve to meet the needs of these machine customers risk disappearing altogether.

Think about that. The "customer" you've been marketing to for decades whose loyalty you've earned through emotional brand stories, discounts, and experiences will soon be joined (or replaced) by digital agents that prioritize speed, price, and efficiency.

Here's my thesis:
* Agentic commerce, where autonomous AI agents transact on behalf of humans, will emerge as a dominant force in commerce, reshaping how brands build relationships with consumers.
* This shift from brand affinity to transactional efficiency will upend decades of marketing and loyalty strategies. AI agents don't buy because they feel connected to your brand; they buy because you're the fastest, most transparent, and most reliable option for their human user's goals.
* Companies that fail to evolve and meet the needs of these machine customers risk disappearing in the new agentic commerce economy.

Accenture's latest research reinforces this shift. Nearly one in ten consumers (9%) already rank generative AI as their single-most trusted source of what to buy, even above social media and brand websites⁶. And 75% of consumers are open to letting AI-powered agents act on their behalf as personal shoppers⁷. Brands that ignore this trend risk being left out of the consideration set altogether.

But here's the challenge: As agentic AI reshapes commerce, brands that only compete on price and specs risk becoming interchangeable, trapped in a race to the bottom. To stand out, retailers need to double down on what AI can't easily commoditize: authentic, emotionally resonant experiences that build human trust and loyalty even when the purchase is driven by an agent. Accenture's research shows that consumers who feel emotionally connected to a brand are 1.7 times more likely to accept a higher price point and 2.3 times more likely to recommend it to others⁸.

That means your customer experience, loyalty programs, and product strategies need to be reimagined for machine personas, while also preserving the human connection. Human preferences and emotions still matter, but they'll increasingly be filtered through digital agents that optimize every decision for efficiency, price, and speed.

Yet, here's where it gets interesting and where retailers have an opportunity to stand out. The research highlights a risk of a "race to the bottom" as agents optimize only for price and specs, potentially making brands interchangeable. But leading brands are finding ways to differentiate. They're investing in what AI can't commoditize: authentic, emotionally resonant experiences that build trust with both human and machine customers.

So what does all of this mean for our industry?

It means that customer experience, loyalty programs, and even your product strategies need to be reimagined for machine personas. Human preferences and emotions will still matter but they'll increasingly be filtered through digital agents prioritizing speed, price, and efficiency.

Retailers need to shift from flashy brand campaigns to building trust with these digital agents. That means investing in transparency, reliability, and real-time data feeds because that's what agents prioritize when deciding who to buy from. It also means defining your role in this evolving ecosystem. Brands must think strategically about partnerships with LLM platforms, optimize for AI discoverability (Generative Engine Optimization), and ensure they're represented in agent-driven purchase decisions.

In the coming weeks, I'll be sharing a series of posts that dive deeper into this transformation. I'll explore how to build trust with digital agents, how to design loyalty programs that motivate both humans and machines, how will these new agentic customers transact and how to reimagine customer journeys and personas for an agentic world, all while preserving the lifetime value of your human customer segments.

The winners of 2030 won't be the ones with the catchiest slogans or the flashiest ads. They'll be the ones who know how to build trust with the machines and the humans behind them.

How do you see this shift affecting your business? Are you ready to serve not just people, but also their digital agents? Share your thoughts in the comments or send me a message.

I'm excited to explore this future and curious to see how it unfolds for all of us.
