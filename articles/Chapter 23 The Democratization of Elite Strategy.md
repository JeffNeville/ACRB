**The Democratization of Elite Strategy: How Agentic AI Levels the Playing Field for SMBs**


*Agentic AI is bringing high-end strategic analysis within reach of small firms, but the technology works only as well as the questions and data it receives.*



A small coffee roaster in San Francisco offers a glimpse of how artificial intelligence is reshaping business strategy. The small firm, which sells beans directly to consumers, told researchers from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that almost half of its sales come through e-commerce. Orders, payments and shipping run on a patchwork of apps. What once looked like digital clutter is turning into a strategy stack. The roaster’s founders no longer need to hire consultants to size markets or sketch growth plans. They can ask a chatbot embedded in their accounting software. Meanwhile, larger retailers are building their own agentic systems. Target has rolled out Store Companion, a generative AI chatbot that sits on employees’ handheld devices and answers on-the-job questions, coaches new staff and supports store operations. For chief executives in retail, AI has become not just a cost-cutting tool but a way to widen access to strategic analysis.



This shift arrives at a crucial moment. Small and medium-sized enterprises account for roughly 90% of all businesses globally and more than half of employment worldwide. In retail, where margins are thin and competition fierce, most firms cannot afford lengthy strategy off-sites or bespoke research. New AI tools promise to automate parts of the analytical work that consultants once performed at premium rates. Yet these same tools may amplify bad data, encourage overconfidence and automate mistakes. Success hinges on the questions companies ask, the quality of their data and the judgment they apply, a pattern later borne out in empirical studies. As AI broadens access to high-value analysis, it also exposes retail leaders to new risks and responsibilities.



**Pyramid scheme**



The idea that AI will make consultants redundant is overdone. A more plausible story, sketched by David Duncan, Tyler Anderson and Jeffrey Saviano in Harvard Business Review, is that AI is reshaping the industry’s structure and bringing some of its services inside companies. The traditional consulting pyramid rested on junior analysts who did research, modeling and slide building, mid-level consultants who synthesized their work, and partners who advised clients. Generative models, predictive algorithms and agent-based assistants now handle much of the entry-level work faster and cheaper. McKinsey’s Lilli, BCG’s Deckster, Bain’s Sage and Deloitte’s Zora automate data gathering and preliminary analysis. As junior workloads shrink, the consulting pyramid begins to crumble.



Retailers are watching this transformation closely. In what Duncan and his co-authors call an obelisk model of consulting, firms flatten into three roles: AI facilitators who manage AI workflows, engagement architects who interpret AI outputs and shape strategies, and client leaders who build relationships and guide change. This structure resonates with how modern retailers operate. Companies like Zara and H&M already combine digital designers, data scientists and merchants in agile pods. Emerging boutiques such as Monevate and Unity Advisory bypass the traditional analyst layer entirely. They use AI to produce insights and prototypes in days rather than months and operate with small, senior-heavy teams, shifting human effort away from number-crunching toward judgment and creativity.



The restructuring is not painless. Consulting pyramids are embedded in firms’ economics, training and culture. Incentives tied to headcount and billable hours make lean transformation hard. Even as retailers invest heavily in AI, many still treat it as a bolt-on rather than a reason to re-architect workflows. Jeffrey Saviano, an ethics scholar and co-author of the Harvard article, stresses that firms must embed governance into AI workflows. Without deliberate reinvention, they risk becoming slower, more expensive and less relevant.



**McKinsey in minutes**



For decades, only large corporations could afford consultants. Philip Parker of INSEAD notes that premium fees from firms like McKinsey, Accenture and Deloitte put sophisticated analysis beyond the reach of most businesses. That constraint is weakening. AI systems can replicate, and in some narrow tasks occasionally exceed, the analytical routines used by human strategists. Parker co-founded Xavier AI, a service that uses what he calls dynamic multi-method generation to benchmark a company’s performance against competitors, estimate market sizes and build financial models in minutes. A prompt such as “Devise a growth strategy for a 50-employee French maker of barbless fly-fishing hooks” yields a ten-page presentation with data provenance and strategic recommendations in about two minutes.



Consulting is formulaic, Parker argues. Firms promise a method rather than an outcome. His system formalizes this by assembling rule-based, cognitive, symbolic, computational and reinforcement techniques. It draws on industry databases, news, public financials and internal documents. Early pilots at a multinational bank sought to help salespeople act as trusted advisers rather than product pushers. Retailers could adapt similar systems to help store managers decide which brands to stock, when to run promotions and how to allocate shelf space.



AI-generated strategy is spreading beyond pure consulting firms. Offerings range from general-purpose assistants such as OpenAI’s GPT-4 to specialized agents embedded in industry platforms. Shopify’s Sidekick assistant now completes tasks like creating discount codes and drafting promotions. Walmart uses AI Pallet Builder and Load Planner tools to improve the way products are grouped, packed and shipped, and digital twins to predict equipment failures in stores weeks ahead. These tools embed strategic choices about pricing, assortment and staffing into everyday workflows.



Retailers are also beginning to feed generative models with their product catalogs to increase visibility on AI-powered search engines. According to the e-commerce data platform Feedonomics, brands are racing to ensure their products appear in AI-driven shopping responses by sending live product feeds enriched with attributes such as use case, audience, material and compatibility. The company reports that 39% of consumers already use generative AI for online shopping and that generative AI-driven traffic surged by 1,300% during the 2024 holiday season, according to Adobe Analytics. The new e-commerce search optimization is about structuring data for large language models. If listings lack detail and context, AI is less likely to recommend them.



**Trojan tactics**



The more consequential shift lies less in stand-alone chatbots than in AI assistants embedded in software retailers already use. Shopify’s Sidekick, built into the merchant dashboard, draws on a shop’s product catalog and sales history. It can propose pricing tactics, draft marketing copy, summarize customer reviews and flag anomalies.[20] Target’s Store Companion sits in employees’ handheld devices and provides instructions on processes from opening a cash register to enrolling a customer in a loyalty program. On Walmart’s sales floor, employees use RFID and augmented reality tools to locate products quickly and digital twins to anticipate maintenance issues.



This integration matters because data quality becomes the bottleneck. When an assistant can summarize reviews, monitor competitors and draft promotions, a retailer’s advantage depends less on hiring armies of analysts and more on maintaining accurate records. The constraint shifts from access to analytic labor to judgment about when to act. Strategy becomes less of an annual exercise and more of a routine interaction with a system that continuously processes new information.



Adoption varies. The OECD observes that generative AI can be a comparatively low-barrier way for small and medium enterprises to start using AI because it can be deployed through existing software and uses natural language. Nonetheless, it warns that the gap between experimenting with tools and changing how work is done is often large. Firms that integrate AI deeply may pull ahead of those that treat it as a novelty. Retail chief executives need to decide whether to be early adopters or cautious followers. Regulatory frameworks such as the European Union’s AI Act and standards like the US National Institute of Standards and Technology’s AI Risk Management Framework will shape how vendors build features and how retailers consume them. Most small firms will absorb these rules indirectly through their software. Large retailers must monitor them directly, especially when using AI in high-risk areas such as credit, hiring or health-related products.



**Garbage amplified**



Cheap advice carries hidden costs. A field experiment in Kenya, led by Rembrand Koning and colleagues at Harvard Business School, tested whether AI-generated business advice could help entrepreneurs scale their ventures. Researchers gave 164 Kenyan business owners access to a custom AI tool trained on expert advice. The tool offered recommendations on pricing, customer targeting, operations and growth, tailored to each firm’s circumstances.



The results were sobering. On average, the AI tool had no measurable impact on business performance. Revenues, profits and employment showed no significant improvement compared with a control group. Worse, the tool widened the gap between high performers and low performers. Entrepreneurs who already ran successful businesses improved their outcomes, while those struggling saw little benefit or even declined. The researchers concluded that AI amplifies existing capabilities rather than substituting for them. High performers asked better questions and selected more relevant advice. Low performers struggled to distinguish useful guidance from noise.



This finding helps explain why judgment, data quality and question-framing matter so much for retailers. An AI assistant can generate a growth plan, but if the underlying assumptions are flawed or the data are sloppy, the plan will mislead. Retail chief executives must ask precise questions: which customer segments are profitable, how conversion rates differ by channel, and which external factors could change the picture. AI can help process the answers but cannot decide which questions to pose.



The Kenyan experiment also revealed that decision-making frameworks matter more than raw information. Researchers enumerated all the advice the AI tool had provided and later asked high-performing and low-performing entrepreneurs to rate each piece. High performers were significantly better at identifying which advice was relevant and actionable. They already possessed the judgment to evaluate recommendations critically. Low performers lacked this skill, and the AI tool did not teach it to them.



**Getting serious**



If agentic AI flattens the consulting pyramid and broadens access to strategic analysis, retailers could build in-house strategy capabilities at low cost. This opportunity is not automatic. To take advantage, retailers must combine AI tools with rigorous data collection and analysis. That means maintaining reliable records of sales by product, channel and geography, tracking inventory levels, markdowns and shrinkage, logging marketing spend, click-through rates and conversion by segment, and integrating customer data that captures demographics, psychographics and purchase histories.



High-quality inputs matter because generative systems can only recombine what they receive. A strategy-in-a-box tool may generate a growth plan, but if the underlying data are sloppy or unrepresentative, the plan will mislead. Agentic workflows can also automate analysis across functions. A fashion retailer might set up an agent to monitor sales trends, inventory levels and competitor pricing, triggering suggestions to reorder or discount products. A grocery chain could run simulations of supply chain disruption, using digital twins to anticipate refrigeration failures or other operational bottlenecks.[29] A department store could segment its loyalty members by lifetime value and churn risk, generating personalized offers for high-value shoppers. E-commerce merchants can feed generative models with structured product data to improve visibility on AI-powered search engines.



By packaging these analyses, software vendors may sell standardized decision-support tools to thousands of retailers. Executives still need to validate outputs, integrate them into budgeting and marketing decisions, and weigh qualitative factors such as brand, community and culture. Forecasts of the eventual size of this market vary widely, reflecting both the appeal of such tools and the uncertainty surrounding a young technology.



**Judgment calls**



As the cost of asking “what if?” falls, the tempo of decision-making will quicken. Businesses will run more experiments and iterate faster. For some retailers, agentic AI will become as routine as spreadsheets, a layer of competence used daily without fanfare. For others, it may create confusion and false confidence. The next few years will reveal whether strategy-in-a-box becomes a default tool or another technology that mainly rewards the already capable.



The outcome hinges on human factors. ***Owners and managers must cultivate their ability to frame questions, interpret data and exercise judgment***. They must treat AI assistants not as replacements for thinking but as aids to it. Regulators and industry bodies will need to ensure that tools are transparent about data sources, limitations and biases. Educators and trade associations can help close skills gaps that otherwise widen inequality.



The democratization of strategy is real in the sense that high-end analysis is becoming cheaper and more accessible. It is not guaranteed that outcomes will converge. Good retail strategy still depends on clear thinking about goals, competitors and customers. No algorithm can supply that on its own. A coffee roaster may get a better dashboard and a smarter chatbot. It still needs to know whether its beans are any good. For a fashion retailer, the question is whether customers feel right in this season’s jacket. AI can help answer many things. It cannot yet tell you what to care about.
