# **The Great Autonomous Commerce Disintermediation**

## **How AI agents are reshaping retail relationships**

The traditional customer journey, once a predictable progression from discovery to purchase, is being fundamentally disrupted by artificial intelligence. AI agents are evolving beyond simple recommendation engines into autonomous purchasing systems that act on behalf of consumers with minimal human oversight. This transformation from AI-influenced to AI-driven commerce represents the most significant shift in retail since the emergence of e-commerce itself.

Recent data provides compelling evidence of this transition. In the United States, Black Friday online sales reached a record $10.8bn, accompanied by an extraordinary 1,800% surge in traffic from generative AI chatbots—clear indication that digital agents already meaningfully influence consumer demand.¹ Adobe and Salesforce reported similarly record-breaking volumes throughout Cyber Week.² The trajectory appears set to accelerate dramatically: Salesforce research indicates that agentic AI adoption will grow 327% by 2027, rising from 15% to 64% of organizations.³ Deloitte expects half of all companies currently using generative AI to be running agent pilots or proofs of concept by 2027.⁴ Perhaps most tellingly, PwC reports that 75% of senior executives believe AI agents will reshape the workplace more profoundly than the internet did.⁵

For retailers, this evolution presents both existential risk and unprecedented opportunity. Those who adapt their operations to serve algorithmic customers may gain significant competitive advantages. Those who fail to do so risk being bypassed entirely.

## **The New Architecture of Commerce**

AI agents are systematically rewiring every stage of the customer journey, beginning with how consumers discover products.

### **Discovery Reimagined**

The traditional browsing experience, characterized by human-driven searches and manual comparison shopping, is rapidly giving way to AI shopping agents capable of compressing hours of research into seconds. These systems synthesize reviews, specifications, pricing, inventory levels, and delivery times into actionable recommendations. Success in this environment requires retailers to make their products "machine-consumable" through clean, structured data, robust APIs, and comprehensive product information.

This emerging discipline is known as Generative Engine Optimization (GEO), described by Andreessen Horowitz as "the competition to get into the model's mind."⁶ Forward-thinking brands are already monitoring how frequently large language models reference their products, treating "reference rate" as a crucial new awareness metric.⁷

The implications extend beyond mere technical optimization. Well over half of American shoppers (61%) already begin product searches on Amazon rather than retailers' own websites.⁸ This discovery gravitational pull now extends to AI intermediaries, potentially creating new layers of distance between brands and consumers. Consumer appetite for such tools appears strong: 55% of American adults express at least moderate interest in AI-driven shopping tools, including image-based search capabilities.⁹ IBM research indicates that three in five consumers would welcome AI applications in their shopping experience.¹⁰

### **Purchasing Transformed**

The purchasing phase reveals AI agents' most disruptive characteristics. Unlike human shoppers, agents optimize ruthlessly for objective criteria. Brand sentiment becomes secondary to price, delivery speed, reliability ratings, and sustainability scores. Deloitte and Salesforce projections suggest that by the late 2020s, agent-to-agent (A2A) transactions, encompassing automatic procurement, multi-seller bidding, and API-level negotiations, will become mainstream across many business workflows.³⁴

This shift toward always-on, machine-to-machine commerce will create sudden order spikes at unconventional hours as agents capitalize on pricing or availability opportunities. The implications for inventory management, logistics, and revenue forecasting are profound.

Conversational commerce is maturing alongside these developments. What began with smart speakers reordering household staples is evolving into comprehensive AI chat journeys capable of handling complex requests such as "Find me an excellent STEM gift for a five-year-old under $50, with next-day delivery." While voice shopping currently represents only approximately $3.3bn in annual sales, industry projections anticipate rapid growth throughout this decade.¹¹

### **Post-Purchase Automation**

Following purchase completion, AI agents will increasingly manage confirmations, track shipments, reschedule missed deliveries, and initiate returns. This transition shifts customer service from human-to-brand interactions toward brand-to-algorithm relationships. Consequently, retailers must redesign loyalty programs to capture algorithmic allegiance alongside human preference. Expect retailers to develop "premium" API access points, offering priority inventory access and superior delivery slots to maintain agent engagement.

## **The Psychology of Delegation**

Consumer willingness to delegate purchasing decisions to AI systems varies significantly by context. Research published in the Journal of Marketing identifies a "word-of-machine effect": consumers rate AI as more competent for utilitarian purchases where function and efficiency dominate, but prefer human judgment for hedonic purchases involving style, taste, and identity.¹² For batteries or detergent, full delegation feels acceptable; for fashion, wine, or travel, buyers retain preference for the pleasure and control of personal discovery.

This distinction suggests divergent strategic paths. Retailers of utilitarian goods should prioritize frictionless, agent-ready execution systems. Hedonic brands should position AI as stylist or collaborator rather than autopilot, maintaining human engagement in the decision-making process.

## **The Trust Imperative**

Despite growing capabilities, consumer trust in AI shopping systems remains fragile. YouGov research indicates that 41% of Americans express no trust in AI shopping assistants, with only 14% having actually used such systems.¹³ Additional surveys show that merely one-third of consumers would currently permit AI to make purchases on their behalf, while over half harbor concerns about data mishandling.¹⁴

These trust deficits represent both challenge and opportunity. Retailers that prioritize ethical AI design, emphasizing privacy protection, explainability, and bias mitigation, may gain competitive advantages as consumers gradually increase their willingness to delegate purchasing decisions.

## **Strategic Responses**

The emergence of AI-driven commerce demands fundamentally different approaches across product categories and business models.

### **The Utilitarian Path**

For commodity and utilitarian categories, success increasingly depends on algorithmic rather than human loyalty. This requires hyper-efficient operations, machine-readable data systems, dynamic pricing capabilities, and API-level loyalty programs. Walmart's AI-powered route optimization provides a compelling example: the system eliminated 30 million miles of travel and avoided 94 million pounds of CO₂ emissions, demonstrating how algorithmic efficiency compounds across operations.¹⁵

### **The Hedonic Strategy**

High-emotion and lifestyle categories face a different challenge: building sufficient brand desire that consumers pre-configure their agents to prefer specific brands, or at least require explicit approval before accepting substitutions. This approach demands emotional storytelling, community building, and "explainable recommendations" that maintain human involvement in decision-making processes.

Both strategies require substantial investment in data infrastructure. Large language models prove unforgiving of messy catalogs, sparse product attributes, or unreliable APIs. Most retailers will need iterative test-and-learn programs to address data gaps and develop repeatable GEO and agent-integration capabilities.

### **Trust as Competitive Advantage**

Walmart's Responsible AI Pledge, emphasizing transparency, security, privacy, fairness, and accountability, provides a template for transforming ethical considerations into strategic advantages.¹⁶ PwC research indicates that trust erodes most rapidly for high-stakes transactions such as financial purchases, suggesting that transparency and control mechanisms should be most robust precisely where consumer skepticism runs highest.⁵

### **Designing for Algorithmic Customers**

Successful retailers must begin treating AI agents as a primary customer segment. This requires shipping structured, high-fidelity product data; offering stable, well-documented APIs; measuring "AI visibility" and "reference rate" metrics; and preparing for A2A procurement processes. GEO represents not merely a marketing trend but an entirely new distribution channel requiring dedicated resources and expertise.

## **The Road Ahead**

The transition to agent-driven commerce will likely unfold unevenly across categories, demographics, and geographic markets. Early adoption will concentrate in utilitarian categories where efficiency gains are most apparent and trust barriers lowest. Gradual expansion into hedonic categories will depend heavily on advances in AI explainability and the development of more sophisticated trust-building mechanisms.

Retailers face a fundamental choice: adapt their operations to serve algorithmic customers, or risk gradual marginalization as AI agents increasingly mediate consumer relationships. Those who act decisively to build agent-friendly capabilities may gain lasting competitive advantages. Those who delay risk discovering that their customers have learned to shop without them.

The agent revolution in retail has begun. Success will belong to those who recognize that artificial intelligence is not merely changing how customers shop, but who customers are.
